# 👋🏼Welcome!

Hey there! My name is Josh and I'm a technical communicator who enjoys creating and sharing documentation. 

The goal of my documentation is to help you get started on projects on a variety of topics and complexities.

This repository contains the landing page for my other repositories containing docs. You can see that landing page at [josh-wong | personal project docs](https://josh-wong.github.io/).
