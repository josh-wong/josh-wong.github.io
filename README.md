# 👋🏼Welcome!

Hey there! My name is **Josh Wong**, and I'm a technical writer and knowledge management specialist living and working in Tokyo.

I enjoy writing, sharing knowledge, improving user experiences, and learning new things💡

This repository contains a site that I've built by using [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

You can see my site at [Ramblings of a technical writer in Tokyo🗼🗾](https://www.080f53.com/).
