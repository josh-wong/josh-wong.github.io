# 👋🏼Welcome!

Hey there! My name is **Josh Wong**, and I'm a technical writer and knowledge management specialist living and working in Kanagawa, Japan.

I enjoy writing, sharing knowledge, improving user experiences, and learning new things💡

This repository contains a site that I've built by using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

You can see my site at [Ramblings of a technical writer in Japan🗾](https://www.080f53.com/).
