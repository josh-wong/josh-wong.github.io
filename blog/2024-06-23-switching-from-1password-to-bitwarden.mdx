# Switching from 1Password to Bitwarden for password management

After using [1Password](https://1password.com/) for more than 10 years, I recently switched to [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) as my password manager. Switching to Bitwarden was a commitment that I needed to act quickly on since my 1Password subscription was up for renewal. This post details my reasons for switching and walks through the process of how I migrated my data.

## Why I decided to switch

Let's be real here: The primary reason for switching was cost.

I needed to decide if paying $59.88 (about ¬•9,500 at the current USD to JPY exchange rate) for the Families plan for another year at the current price was worth the cost. Because of this, I started researching other password manager solutions.

1Password is a great password management solution for businesses, primarily because you can centrally manage passwords and access to those passwords for everyone in an organization. Also, as of publishing this blog post, [1Password offers free access to their Families plan if your organization is using 1Password for Business](https://support.1password.com/link-family/), which is a nice perk!

I decided to switch to Bitwarden because of the following:

- **Cost:** Bitwarden offers a free version, which I imagine is enough for most users. Among the [plans available](https://bitwarden.com/pricing/), I decided on the Premium plan since I wanted to use some of the features available in that offering. 
- **Open-source:** I liked how Bitwarden's core password management solution is [open source(https://bitwarden.com/open-source/). In addition, Bitwarden offers a self-hosted solution that I might consider setting up in the future.
- **Cross-platform compatibility:** Similar to 1Password, Bitwarden works seamlessly across all my devices.

## Migrating my data

The first step was to export my data from 1Password in the **.1pux** format, and then import the data into Bitwarden. This was where I hit a few snags.

When importing my data into Bitwarden, I encountered a few issues:

- **"Sign in with" isn't supported in Bitwarden.** All login credentials that use **Sign in with Google**, for example, show my email address with no indication that those credentials are tied to my Google account. Instead, the entry in Bitwarden looks like I have a username without a password saved.
- **Created and modified dates for entries weren't migrated.** The date of all login entries have a timestamp of when I imported the entries, not when those entries were actually created and modified.
- **Archived login entries were mixed with unarchived entries.** Login entries that I had labeled as archived and placed in a folder away from the active entries were mixed with active login entries. Fortunately, I had made notes of when I'd archived entries in the **Notes** field, but having entries for both valid and invalid login credentials was frustrating.
- **Loss of Markdown formatting in login entry notes.** Bitwarden doesn't support Markdown in the **Notes** field of entries, so some of my notes are a little hard to understand at first glance.

None of these issues were showstopping. In fact, they probably did more to highlight how much I was relying on certain functionality that I didn't really need to use.

In fact, I reduced the amount of entries that I'd previously archived and would probably never look at again. Some spring cleaning of unnecessary data decluttered the entries I'd saved and contributed to a fresh start.

## Getting used to Bitwarden

Naturally, especially after using 1Password for more than 10 years, the UIs across Bitwarden for desktop, mobile, and browser felt quite a bit different from the UIs for 1Password. However, after a few days, I was used to the layouts, features, and how to configure settings across platforms. Simply put, Bitwarden offered all the essential functions I needed, just organized and presented a little differently compared to 1Password.

In addition, usability across platforms has been just as easy as my experience with 1Password.

## Wrap-up

While 1Password served me well for more than 10 years, I've been happy with my switch to Bitwarden. I've been able to meet all my password management needs at a lower cost while supporting an open-source solution, without sacrificing usability.

Again, I think 1Password is excellent for organizations. However, if you're looking for a password management solution for yourself or for your family, [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) is definitely worth a look.

Remember that the most important thing is to use a password manager, regardless of which one you chooseüîê
