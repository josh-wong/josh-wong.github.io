# Recap of my participation in the 2024 TELL Step Up Challenge

This year, I participated in the Step Up Challenge by [TELL Japan](https://telljp.com/), which is an event to honor the 21,837 people who lost their lives to suicide in Japan in 2023. The purpose of this event is to raise mental-health awareness and funds for TELL to continue providing lifesaving services to the English-speaking community in Japan. Although you can participate in the event solo or as a group, I decided to join as an individual.

For English speakers living in Japan who are struggling and need someone to talk to, I recommend contacting TELL through their [Lifeline service](https://telljp.com/lifeline/). The organization's website also regularly posts on their blog and offers a plethora of resources if you prefer to get help at your own pace outside of their support hours.

Many of us struggle at some point, so I highly recommend keeping TELL top of mind if you find yourself going through a difficult time.

## Why I took part in the 2024 Step Up Challenge

In 2023, 21,837 people lost their lives to suicide compared to 21,881 people in 2022. I believe we can significantly reduce how many people lose their lives to suicide by promoting services like TELL and by simply listening and checking in on each other.

For the past two years, I've participated in this event. Although I didn't write a post about participating in last year's event, you can read a recap about the first time that I participated at [Recap of my participation in the 2022 TELL 21,007 Step Up Challenge](2022-10-11-tell-step-up-challenge.mdx).

## How I participated in the 2024 Step Up Challenge

To honor those who lost their lives to suicide in 2023, I went on a 12.0 km hike in Mt. Ohira in Kamakura with my wife and a few friends. On that day, I walked a total of 26,124 steps.

Unfortunately, I had some things blocking me from achieving 21,837 steps again, like rainy weather and not feeling well. However, that gave me time to meditate, write detailed notes in my daily journal, and do other things to reflect on and consider my own mental well-being.

## Wrap-up

As in previous years, participating in the TELL Step Up Challenge gives me extra motivation to exercise and to think about mental health. I do regret not being able to get to 21,837 steps more than once between September 10 and October 10, but nothing's stopping me from hitting that a few more times before the end of the yearüö∂üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è
