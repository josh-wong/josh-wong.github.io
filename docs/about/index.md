# About

Hey there! My name is [Josh](https://github.com/josh-wong/), and I'm a technical writer and knowledge management specialist. 

I enjoy writing, improving user experiences, learning new things, and sharing knowledge.

## Why "080f53.com"?

I like the hex color <a href="https://encycolorpedia.com/080f53" target="_blank">**#080f53**</a>, which is dark blue-violet. For consistency between domain name and design, I've applied this color throughout the site.

Also, finding unique domain names is hard.
