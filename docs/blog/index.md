Thoughts and observations of a technical writer in TokyoðŸ—¼ðŸ—¾

## Why "080f53.com"?

I like the hex color <a href="https://encycolorpedia.com/080f53" target="_blank">**#080f53**</a>, which is dark blue-violet. For consistency between domain name and design, I've applied this color throughout the site.

Also, finding unique domain names is hard.
