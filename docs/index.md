Hey there! My name is Josh and I'm a technical communicator who enjoys creating and sharing documentation. 

This site is a knowledge base that links to documentation for some of my personal projects. My goal here is to help you get started on projects on a variety of topics and complexities.

Feel free to poke around and reach out if you have any questions!üòä
