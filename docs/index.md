# Welcome!

Hey there! My name is Josh and I'm a technical writer.

The goal of this site is for me to:

- continue to improve on my writing and knowledge management skills, 
- practice writing software and the related documentation, and
- go hands-on with new trends and best practices in documentation and knowledge management.

Feel free to poke around and contact me if you have any questions!ðŸ˜Š
