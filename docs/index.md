# 👋🏼Welcome!

Hey there! My name is Josh and I'm a technical writer. This is a knowledge base that contains documentation for my side projects. 

I'm sharing my knowledge to help you learn from my hands-on experiences, often with technology or products that lack easy-to-follow documentation.

Feel free to poke around, and reach out if you have any questions!😊
