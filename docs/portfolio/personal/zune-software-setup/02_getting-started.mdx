# Getting started

Before you begin set up, confirm that you can turn on your Zune device and that is working as expected.

:::note

I confirmed that these instructions work when using a Zune HD. If you have an earlier Zune model, you should be able to follow these instructions as well. However, the apps and games can be installed only on a Zune HD.

:::

## Prerequisites

- PC running Windows 10

:::warning

In Windows 11, the Zune driver does not automatically install after plugging in the device. I'm currently troubleshooting the issue and will update these instructions after I find and confirm a resolution.

- Zune device
- Zune charging cable
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
	- You'll need to make admin changes to the "hosts" file in Windows. To do this, you'll use Notepad++ since the default text editor in Windows may not allow you to make administrator-level changes.
- Internet connection
