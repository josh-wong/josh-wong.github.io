Since I didn’t have plans on my first day off for the 2023 New Year holiday break, I decided to get my &lt;abbr title=&#34;A series of small, single-board computers (SBCs) developed in the by the Raspberry Pi Foundation in association with Broadcom&#34;&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/abbr&gt; 4 running again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;admonition info&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;admonition-title&#34;&gt;Disclosure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some links in this post are affiliate links.

I wanted to get back to contributing to the health of &lt;abbr title=&#34;A proof-of-work blockchain payment network and cryptocurrency that&#39;s based on Bitcoin but faster and cheaper to use &amp;lt;!-- Definition based on Cointelegraph.com --&amp;gt;&#34;&gt;Bitcoin Cash&lt;/abbr&gt; and eventually use the device to run some other Linux-only programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following is what I did to get my &lt;abbr title=&#34;A series of small, single-board computers (SBCs) developed in the by the Raspberry Pi Foundation in association with Broadcom&#34;&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/abbr&gt; 4 running again and some of the programs I&#39;ve set it up to run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;removed-the-problematic-fan&#34;&gt;Removed the problematic fan&lt;a class=&#34;headerlink&#34; href=&#34;#removed-the-problematic-fan&#34; title=&#34;Permanent link&#34;&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The easy solution was to simply unplug the fan from the &lt;abbr title=&#34;An uncommitted digital signal pin on an integrated circuit or electronic circuit board that can be used as an input or output, or both, and is controllable by software&#34;&gt;GPIO&lt;/abbr&gt; pins and remove it from the case. Now I just hope the heat sinks are enough to keep the device cool. So far, so good!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At some point, I&#39;ll dig out a spare fan from my box of miscellaneous gadgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;upgraded-ubuntu-to-22041-lts-jammy-jellyfish&#34;&gt;Upgraded Ubuntu to 22.04.1 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)&lt;a class=&#34;headerlink&#34; href=&#34;#upgraded-ubuntu-to-22041-lts-jammy-jellyfish&#34; title=&#34;Permanent link&#34;&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next up on the to-do list: check for an operating system upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I booted up my &lt;abbr title=&#34;A series of small, single-board computers (SBCs) developed in the by the Raspberry Pi Foundation in association with Broadcom&#34;&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/abbr&gt; 4 and tried updating Ubuntu, I was greeted with an error message that my version of Ubuntu, v21.10 (Impish Indri), was no longer eligible for updates. To get around this issue, I followed the troubleshooting workaround at &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades&#34;&gt;EOLUpgrades | Ubuntu Documentation&lt;/a&gt; to enable upgrading to a newer version of Ubuntu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After modifying the &lt;code&gt;sources.list&lt;/code&gt; file as stated in the instructions, I ran the update and upgrade commands in Terminal. The workaround worked, and I was able to upgrade Ubuntu from 21.10 (Impish Indri) to Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish) on my &lt;abbr title=&#34;A series of small, single-board computers (SBCs) developed in the by the Raspberry Pi Foundation in association with Broadcom&#34;&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/abbr&gt; 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No noticeable surprises with this upgrade since I’m not an Ubuntu power user.

To continue contributing to the health of the network after that date, I would need to upgrade the &lt;abbr title=&#34;A point of connection in a communication network&#34;&gt;node&lt;/abbr&gt; software from v24.0.0 to v25.0.0.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Bitcoin Cash Node &amp;quot;About&amp;quot; window showing v25.0.0&#34; src=&#34;../../../../assets/assets/images/2023-01-12-bitcoin-cash-node-about.png&#34; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Bitcoin Cash Node &#34;About&#34; window showing v25.0.0&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When upgrading the &lt;abbr title=&#34;A proof-of-work blockchain payment network and cryptocurrency that&#39;s based on Bitcoin but faster and cheaper to use &amp;lt;!-- Definition based on Cointelegraph.com --&amp;gt;&#34;&gt;Bitcoin Cash&lt;/abbr&gt; Node software to v25.0.0, I referred to the tutorial that I’d created when I upgraded from v23.0.0 to v24.0.0.

However, I couldn’t access the USB ports on my desktop running Windows, even after following the instructions in &lt;a href=&#34;https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/connecting-usb-devices-to-wsl/&#34;&gt;Connecting USB devices to WSL&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of this issue, I switched to using my &lt;abbr title=&#34;A series of small, single-board computers (SBCs) developed in the by the Raspberry Pi Foundation in association with Broadcom&#34;&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/abbr&gt; 4 and followed the instructions at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.section.io/engineering-education/recover-deleted-files-with-foremost/&#34;&gt;Recovering deleted files using Foremost&lt;/a&gt;. After setting up the software, I was immediately able to run the program on an empty USB drive and external hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8 GB USB drive:&lt;/strong&gt; After 9 minutes, Foremost recovered 170 deleted files.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Four of the files were old PDF and JPEG files that I had recently printed out at a nearby convenience store.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The remaining 166 files were part of the USB drive software.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 TB external hard drive:&lt;/strong&gt; After 14 hours, Foremost recovered only 4 deleted files. I expected this outcome because I have a habit of reformatting unused drives multiple times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two of the files were corrupt.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The other two files were blank GIFs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the types of files that Foremost can recover is limited, understanding how to use and having hands-on experience with data recovery tools is a nice-to-have skill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;wrap-up&#34;&gt;Wrap-up&lt;a class=&#34;headerlink&#34; href=&#34;#wrap-up&#34; title=&#34;Permanent link&#34;&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My &lt;abbr title=&#34;A series of small, single-board computers (SBCs) developed in the by the Raspberry Pi Foundation in association with Broadcom&#34;&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/abbr&gt; 4 has been running perfectly for about two weeks.

But sometimes, we need to wait a full day (or two!) for clothing like jeans and hooded sweatshirts to completely dry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After researching machines and confirming that one would fit, my wife and I decided to buy a &lt;a href=&#34;https://hb.afl.rakuten.co.jp/ichiba/2e8bd7b9.a36d0b3a.2e8bd7ba.af228498/_RTLink64352?pc=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.rakuten.co.jp%2Fbiccamera%2F4549980677285%2F&amp;amp;link_type=hybrid_url&amp;amp;ut=eyJwYWdlIjoiaXRlbSIsInR5cGUiOiJoeWJyaWRfdXJsIiwic2l6ZSI6IjI0MHgyNDAiLCJuYW0iOjEsIm5hbXAiOiJyaWdodCIsImNvbSI6MSwiY29tcCI6ImRvd24iLCJwcmljZSI6MCwiYm9yIjoxLCJjb2wiOjEsImJidG4iOjEsInByb2QiOjAsImFtcCI6ZmFsc2V9&#34;&gt;Panasonic NA-LX127BL-W (Japanese)&lt;/a&gt;. This front-loading, drum-type machine uses a heat-pump system for drying, which dries clothes pretty darn quick.

We&#39;ve reduced how much time we spend hanging clothes out to dry and saved a lot of time waiting for those clothes to dry. Our clothes also smell much more pleasant and feel a lot softer!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;tried-resurrecting-a-problematic-hard-drive&#34;&gt;Tried resurrecting a problematic hard drive&lt;a class=&#34;headerlink&#34; href=&#34;#tried-resurrecting-a-problematic-hard-drive&#34; title=&#34;Permanent link&#34;&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A friend told me that his computer refused to recognize his external hard drive. On top of that, the hard drive made a clicking sound. I offered to troubleshoot the issue on my computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tried the following methods to salvage the problematic hard drive:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plugged the hard drive into my desktop and then my laptop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;No change. Both computers exhibited the same behavior of briefly showing a connection to the hard drive but neither were able to show the contents of the hard drive. After a while, both computers were eventually unable to connect to the hard drive, which caused an endless loop of the computer trying to install the device driver.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uninstalled the driver when Device Manager finds the device, then restarted my computer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;No change. The drive still didn&#39;t appear in the list of available drives.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Installed WD Drive Utilities to see if the hard drive appeared in the utilities software&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;The drive does appear in this tool even after restarting the computer and unplugging and plugging in the device again.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Followed the steps in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/How+to+Shuck+a+WD+Elements+External+Hard+Drive/137646&#34;&gt;How to Shuck a WD Elements External Hard Drive&lt;/a&gt; to open the external casing of the hard drive to check if there were any loose parts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Nothing seemed loose.

Unfortunately, I lack the tools to open the disk enclosure and inspect the issue further.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Followed the steps in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/How+to+Shuck+a+WD+Elements+External+Hard+Drive/137646&#34;&gt;How to Shuck a WD Elements External Hard Drive&lt;/a&gt; to cover the 3.3V pin with tape.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Covering the 3.3V pin with tape didn&#39;t work.

Coincidentally, my aunt and uncle who visited this November were the last relatives I saw in person in December 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had a heckuva two weeks, going to various places and trying out some new food spots. To get away from Tokyo for a bit, we went to a couple spots: Nikko and Kamakura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;short-trip-to-nikko&#34;&gt;Short trip to Nikko&lt;a class=&#34;headerlink&#34; href=&#34;#short-trip-to-nikko&#34; title=&#34;Permanent link&#34;&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nikko is an amazing spot to check out in the fall when the leaves change color. We got the about a week after peak leaf-changing season, but the sights of the foliage was still perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;A gate inside of Toshogu&#34; src=&#34;../../../../assets/assets/images/2022-12-05-nikko-trip-toshogu-shrine.jpg&#34; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A gate inside of Toshogu&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we strolled around the area, which is serene yet a two-hour ride from Tokyo, I could envision myself living there when I want some peace and quiet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Mid-color foliage changing&#34; src=&#34;../../../../assets/assets/images/2022-12-05-nikko-foliage.jpg&#34; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Mid-color foliage changing&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-trip-to-kamakura&#34;&gt;Day trip to Kamakura&lt;a class=&#34;headerlink&#34; href=&#34;#day-trip-to-kamakura&#34; title=&#34;Permanent link&#34;&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I forget how close Kamakura is to Tokyo. My aunt wanted to visit Kamakura, so I happily obliged and took another day off work to show her and my uncle around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hadn&#39;t been to the giant Buddha statue in at least 16 years, so visiting the area again was a nice stroll down memory lane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Giant Buddha statue (daibutsu) in Kamakura&#34; src=&#34;../../../../assets/assets/images/2022-12-05-kamakura-trip-daibutsu.jpg&#34; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Giant Buddha statue (daibutsu) in Kamakura&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;configured-a-custom-domain&#34;&gt;Configured a custom domain&lt;a class=&#34;headerlink&#34; href=&#34;#configured-a-custom-domain&#34; title=&#34;Permanent link&#34;&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I bought a domain and am actually using it!

I’ve got some more tweaking to do, but I&#39;ll apply those minor changes as time permits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Most of the following definitions are courtesy of Wikipedia, unless otherwise noted. --&gt;&lt;!-- *[Bitcoin]: An innovative proof-of-work blockchain payment network and a new kind of money --&gt;&lt;!-- Definition based on Bitcoin.org --&gt;</description><link>https://www.080f53.com/blog/2022/12/month-in-review-november/?utm_source=documentation&amp;utm_medium=RSS&amp;utm_campaign=feed-syndication</link> <pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0900</pubDate><source url="https://www.080f53.com/feed_rss_created.xml">josh-wong | blog and projects</source><comments>https://www.080f53.com/blog/2022/12/month-in-review-november/#__comments</comments><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.080f53.com/blog/2022/12/month-in-review-november/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Key points about knowledge management from &#34;The Art of Readable Code&#34;</title> <author>josh-wong</author> <category>Books</category> <category>book reviews</category> <category>books</category> <category>knowledge management</category> <category>software engineering</category> <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;key-points-about-knowledge-management-from-the-art-of-readable-code&#34;&gt;Key points about &lt;abbr title=&#34;A collection of methods relating to creating, sharing, using, and managing knowledge and information&#34;&gt;knowledge management&lt;/abbr&gt; from &#34;The Art of Readable Code&#34;&lt;a class=&#34;headerlink&#34; href=&#34;#key-points-about-knowledge-management-from-the-art-of-readable-code&#34; title=&#34;Permanent link&#34;&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month, I read &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3TyC4CJ&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Art of Readable Code: Simple and Practical Techniques for Writing Better Code&lt;/a&gt; on Kindle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I wish I&#39;d read this book years ago.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; As a &lt;abbr title=&#34;A professional information communicator whose task is to transfer information between two or more parties&#34;&gt;technical writer&lt;/abbr&gt; and &lt;abbr title=&#34;A collection of methods relating to creating, sharing, using, and managing knowledge and information&#34;&gt;knowledge management&lt;/abbr&gt; specialist, the first part focuses on &lt;abbr title=&#34;A collection of methods relating to creating, sharing, using, and managing knowledge and information&#34;&gt;knowledge management&lt;/abbr&gt; and best practices for &lt;abbr title=&#34;Any communicable material that is used to describe, explain, or instruct regarding some attributes of an object, system, or procedure&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/abbr&gt; within code.

The first half of the book guides the reader on how to best write code and leave comments for future reference or for others to reference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Cartoon strip &amp;quot;Take us to your leader... if he knows how to program&amp;quot; from &amp;quot;The Art of Readable Code&amp;quot;&#34; src=&#34;../../../../assets/assets/images/2022-11-27-art-of-readable-code-take-us-to-your-leader-maybe.jpg&#34; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Cartoon strip from &#34;The Art of Readable Code&#34;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-takeaways&#34;&gt;Key takeaways&lt;a class=&#34;headerlink&#34; href=&#34;#key-takeaways&#34; title=&#34;Permanent link&#34;&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kind of tacit knowledge that often comes with coding is difficult to share in an easily digestible format, whether written or verbally. However, I think the authors did a great job of explaining how to document that knowledge to help others gain from and build on that code, and address ideas and concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;make-our-code-easy-to-read&#34;&gt;Make our code easy to read&lt;a class=&#34;headerlink&#34; href=&#34;#make-our-code-easy-to-read&#34; title=&#34;Permanent link&#34;&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making code easy to read can be subjective, and leaving comments can add time to finalizing code. But keep this in mind: We may need to refer to our own &lt;abbr title=&#34;Any communicable material that is used to describe, explain, or instruct regarding some attributes of an object, system, or procedure&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/abbr&gt; in three weeks, three months, or three years. We can&#39;t guarantee knowledge retention amongst ourselves or our peers, so clearly documenting ideas or concerns is vital for saving time in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal with comments or streamlined, self-explanatory code is to help our future selves and others to sufficiently understand code that may:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;be difficult to understand,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;affect other parts of the code, or&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;be improved on in the future.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;admonition quote&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;admonition-title&#34;&gt;Quote&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;We may need to refer to our own &lt;abbr title=&#34;Any communicable material that is used to describe, explain, or instruct regarding some attributes of an object, system, or procedure&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/abbr&gt; in three weeks, three months, or three years. We can&#39;t guarantee knowledge retention amongst ourselves or our peers, so clearly documenting ideas or concerns is vital for saving time in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;By sharing our knowledge in code, we can quickly remember why our code works a certain way and describe to others how they can improve that code later on. And again, we can help ourselves and others save time—for example, on retrying fixes, understanding what a function is, or explaining how a function can be improved upon later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;consider-our-audience&#34;&gt;Consider our audience&lt;a class=&#34;headerlink&#34; href=&#34;#consider-our-audience&#34; title=&#34;Permanent link&#34;&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When sharing knowledge in code, we should consider our current target audience and our future self and future colleagues who may need to refer to that code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some examples of why we need to consider our audience include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Organizations hire new employees who aren&#39;t familiar with the its products or culture.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People take on new roles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Organizations shrink and need others to take on additional responsibilities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We naturally forget knowledge over time if we don&#39;t actively use it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both of these cases, people will need to read and understand our code. Imagine how much time we could save for ourselves and others by leaving a well-documented thought or streamlining code to be self-explanatory without needing comments to explain what the code does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;admonition quote&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;admonition-title&#34;&gt;Quote&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;Sharing our knowledge empowers others to use their unique skills and experiences to further build on or improve on that code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another positive effect of considering our audience and sharing our knowledge in code is that people will be more likely to contribute. Think of the old adage &#34;strength in numbers.&#34; Sharing our knowledge empowers others to use their unique skills and experiences to further build on or improve on that code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we can get more people contributing, whether it&#39;s inside the code or in a knowledge base, we can foster a strong culture of &lt;abbr title=&#34;Any communicable material that is used to describe, explain, or instruct regarding some attributes of an object, system, or procedure&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/abbr&gt; and knowledge sharing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;exhibit-humility-in-code-comments&#34;&gt;Exhibit humility in code comments&lt;a class=&#34;headerlink&#34; href=&#34;#exhibit-humility-in-code-comments&#34; title=&#34;Permanent link&#34;&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another part of the book that I found interesting was the authors&#39; suggestion to document where parts of the code could be improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This honest approach and self-critiquing of one&#39;s code takes quite a bit of humility and psychological safety within an organization to be effective. With this approach, an entire organization or a small team can foster a culture of learning that engineers—both current and future—can benefit from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;wrap-up&#34;&gt;Wrap-up&lt;a class=&#34;headerlink&#34; href=&#34;#wrap-up&#34; title=&#34;Permanent link&#34;&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I&#39;m not skilled at writing code, the last half of the book was a little difficult to completely understand. However, I still found value in the content and could imagine re-reading parts to gradually gain a better understanding of the best practices that the author describes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you write code for work or for fun, I highly recommend reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3TyC4CJ&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Art of Readable Code: Simple and Practical Techniques for Writing Better Code&lt;/a&gt;.

As someone who continuously thinks about events and &#34;what if&#34; situations that I don&#39;t have control over, this book helped me think about how to move past those times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real value was not so much in reading the book, but highlighting parts that resonated with me. I&#39;ve already referred to some of my highlights, and a month has barely passed since finishing the book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re interested in seeing my highlights, check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://josh-wong.github.io/kindle-highlights-notes/The%20Art%20of%20Letting%20GO/&#34;&gt;The Art of Letting Go | josh-wong&#39;s Kindle highlights &amp;amp; notes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;passgen-v3x-updates&#34;&gt;passGen v3.x updates&lt;a class=&#34;headerlink&#34; href=&#34;#passgen-v3x-updates&#34; title=&#34;Permanent link&#34;&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, I developed &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/josh-wong/passGen&#34;&gt;passGen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which is a Windows app for creating randomly generated, 14-character passwords. At a previous job, I was helping some engineers design the UI of a Windows app, and I wanted to get familiar with C#. I ended up changing jobs soon after and shelved this project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I revived this old project because I wanted to learn a little about how automatic updates work. Although the automatic-update function isn&#39;t pretty or customizable since I used the built-in &#34;Publish&#34; function in Visual Studio, I enjoyed the challenge and learning some basics about the architecture an app uses to check for updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some notable changes include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/josh-wong/passGen/releases/tag/v3.0.0&#34;&gt;passGen v3.0.0.0&lt;/a&gt;: Added an automatic-update function and improved the UI a bit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/josh-wong/passGen/releases/tag/v3.1.0&#34;&gt;passGen v3.1.0.0&lt;/a&gt;: Changed the password length from 10 characters to 14 characters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re interested in how passGen works, visit &lt;a href=&#34;https://josh-wong.github.io/passGen/&#34;&gt;passGen &lt;abbr title=&#34;Any communicable material that is used to describe, explain, or instruct regarding some attributes of an object, system, or procedure&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Most of the following definitions are courtesy of Wikipedia, unless otherwise noted. --&gt;&lt;!-- *[Bitcoin]: An innovative proof-of-work blockchain payment network and a new kind of money --&gt;&lt;!-- Definition based on Bitcoin.org --&gt;</description><link>https://www.080f53.com/blog/2022/11/month-in-review-october/?utm_source=documentation&amp;utm_medium=RSS&amp;utm_campaign=feed-syndication</link> <pubDate>Sun, 13 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0900</pubDate><source url="https://www.080f53.com/feed_rss_created.xml">josh-wong | blog and projects</source><comments>https://www.080f53.com/blog/2022/11/month-in-review-october/#__comments</comments><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.080f53.com/blog/2022/11/month-in-review-october/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Adding a smart function to my heated blanket</title> <author>josh-wong</author> <category>Automation</category> <category>automation</category> <category>iot</category> <category>smart home</category> <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;adding-a-smart-function-to-my-heated-blanket&#34;&gt;Adding a smart function to my heated blanket&lt;a class=&#34;headerlink&#34; href=&#34;#adding-a-smart-function-to-my-heated-blanket&#34; title=&#34;Permanent link&#34;&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every autumn and winter, I avoid turning on the HVAC units and space heaters in my apartment until absolutely necessary.

If you&#39;re in the US, &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3Fm7IzL&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Amazon US also sells a wide selection of heated blankets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I chose a heated &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;throw&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; blanket, which is thinner than a standard blanket, because:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wanted a blanket that I could either lie on as a bed mat or drape over me while I sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I planned to used another, slightly thicker blanket while I slept.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wanted a blanket to use in the living room or home office.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;making-my-heated-blanket-smart&#34;&gt;Making my heated blanket smart&lt;a class=&#34;headerlink&#34; href=&#34;#making-my-heated-blanket-smart&#34; title=&#34;Permanent link&#34;&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Never to miss a chance to automate even the most basic tasks, I purchased a &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3TI6B1P&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;TP-Link Tapo smart plug on Amazon Japan&lt;/a&gt; to create a smart heated blanket. If you&#39;re in the US, &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3U4MJWb&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Amazon US also sells the Tapo smart plug&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tapo smart plug is an IoT device that enables you to control devices remotely. In this case, I can control the smart plug from the TP-Link Tapo app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;admonition note&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;admonition-title&#34;&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the remote control for adjusting the temperature of the blanket is analog, I can&#39;t adjust the temperature automatically. However, I can still manually adjust the temperature on the remote control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After connecting the Tapo smart plug to my Wi-Fi network, I configured the Tapo app to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Turn on the plug before I go to sleep, and turn it off after 30 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Turn on the plug 10 minutes before my alarm goes off, and turn it off 10 minutes after my alarm goes off.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;By setting these schedules, I accomplish the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Getting into a warm bed without the feeling of cold bed sheets&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Holding myself accountable for going to bed on time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Waking up in a warm bed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Holding myself accountable for not lounging around in bed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Screenshot of schedule in TP Link Tapo app&#34; src=&#34;../../../../assets/assets/images/2022-10-31-tplink-tapo-app-schedule.jpg&#34; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshot of my schedule in the TP Link Tapo app&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, I might consider adding on/off intervals to ensure I stay warm throughout the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also configured the Tapo smart plug through the Shortcuts app in iOS. This allows me to press a button in the Shortcuts widget to turn my blanket on or off. In the future, I&#39;ll look in to being able to turn my heated blanket on or off by using Alexa or Siri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Screenshot of my Shortcut widgets screen&#34; src=&#34;../../../../assets/assets/images/2022-10-31-shortcuts-widget.jpg&#34; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshot of my Shortcut widgets screen&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;ready-for-winter&#34;&gt;Ready for winter!&lt;a class=&#34;headerlink&#34; href=&#34;#ready-for-winter&#34; title=&#34;Permanent link&#34;&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, my smart heated throw blanket has been a great addition to my cold-weather arsenal. Aside from using the blanket when sleeping, I underestimated draping the blanket over my lap while working in my home office. Overall, I highly recommend getting a heated blanket and making it smart to make sleeping during autumn and winter a bit more relaxing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have one more Tapo smart plug left, so I might use it to automate the lights for my Christmas tree.🎄&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;admonition material-update&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;admonition-title&#34;&gt;Update&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 2022, I used my remaining Tapo smart plug to automatically turn on the lights on my Christmas tree every morning at 7:00 AM and turn off the lights at 11:00 PM. By automating this task, I didn&#39;t have to remember to turn on the lights in the morning or turn them off at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- Most of the following definitions are courtesy of Wikipedia, unless otherwise noted. --&gt;&lt;!-- *[Bitcoin]: An innovative proof-of-work blockchain payment network and a new kind of money --&gt;&lt;!-- Definition based on Bitcoin.org --&gt;</description><link>https://www.080f53.com/blog/2022/10/adding-a-smart-function-to-my-heated-blanket/?utm_source=documentation&amp;utm_medium=RSS&amp;utm_campaign=feed-syndication</link> <pubDate>Mon, 31 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0900</pubDate><source url="https://www.080f53.com/feed_rss_created.xml">josh-wong | blog and projects</source><comments>https://www.080f53.com/blog/2022/10/adding-a-smart-function-to-my-heated-blanket/#__comments</comments><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.080f53.com/blog/2022/10/adding-a-smart-function-to-my-heated-blanket/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Recap of my participation in the 2022 TELL 21,007 Step Up Challenge</title> <author>josh-wong</author> <category>Health</category> <category>charity</category> <category>health</category> <category>japan</category> <category>mental health</category> <category>physical health</category> <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;recap-of-my-participation-in-the-2022-tell-21007-step-up-challenge&#34;&gt;Recap of my participation in the 2022 TELL 21,007 Step Up Challenge&lt;a class=&#34;headerlink&#34; href=&#34;#recap-of-my-participation-in-the-2022-tell-21007-step-up-challenge&#34; title=&#34;Permanent link&#34;&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, I participated in the Step Up Challenge by &lt;a href=&#34;https://telljp.com/&#34;&gt;TELL Japan&lt;/a&gt;, which is an event to honor the people who lost their lives to suicide in Japan in 2021. The purpose of this event is to raise mental-health awareness and funds for TELL to continue providing lifesaving services to the English-speaking community in Japan. Although you can participate in the event solo or as a group, I decided to join as an individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;p&gt;By registering for the event, you may be eligible to receive event goodies (while supplies last!). This year&#39;s goodie bag included a nice tote bag, which was perfect for holding my water bottle, phone, wallet, keys, and any groceries I bought during my walks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;2022 TELL Step Up Challenge swag: tote bag and sticker&#34; src=&#34;../../../../assets/assets/images/2022-10-10-tell-step-up-challenge-tote-bag-sticker.jpg&#34; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;2022 TELL Step Up Challenge swag: tote bag and sticker&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For details about the Step Up Challenge and other events, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tellevents.org/&#34;&gt;TELL Japan events&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-im-taking-part-in-the-2022-step-up-challenge&#34;&gt;Why I&#39;m taking part in the 2022 Step Up Challenge&lt;a class=&#34;headerlink&#34; href=&#34;#why-im-taking-part-in-the-2022-step-up-challenge&#34; title=&#34;Permanent link&#34;&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I heard about TELL on Twitter a few years ago, but I didn&#39;t know about this event until I read about it on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nanikore.net/2021/10/11/tell-21081-steps/&#34;&gt;&#34;TELL 21,081 Steps&#34; blog post on nanikore.net&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Living in Japan can get rough for nonnative residents. I had heard about how many foreigners struggle with how to proceed after around five years because of being homesick, wanting a better job, or other factors. I experienced a similar situation around my five-year anniversary mark. If I knew about TELL at that time, I believe I would have gotten the support that I needed and potentially saved quite a lot of yen on questionably helpful self-help books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simply put:&lt;/strong&gt; I believe in TELL&#39;s service and want to support their mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-i-participated-in-the-2022-step-up-challenge&#34;&gt;How I participated in the 2022 Step Up Challenge&lt;a class=&#34;headerlink&#34; href=&#34;#how-i-participated-in-the-2022-step-up-challenge&#34; title=&#34;Permanent link&#34;&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To honor the 21,007 people who lost their lives to suicide in 2021, I walked 21,007+ steps around Tokyo on the following dates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;details class=&#34;success&#34;&gt;&lt;summary&gt;September 10, 2022 - 21,034 steps&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;2022 TELL Step Up Challenge: September 10, 2022 - 21,034 steps&#34; src=&#34;../../../../assets/assets/images/2022-10-10-tell-step-up-challenge-%2809-10%29.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;details class=&#34;success&#34;&gt;&lt;summary&gt;September 17, 2022 - 22,197 steps&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;2022 TELL Step Up Challenge: September 17, 2022 - 22,197 steps&#34; src=&#34;../../../../assets/assets/images/2022-10-10-tell-step-up-challenge-%2809-17%29.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;details class=&#34;success&#34;&gt;&lt;summary&gt;October 10, 2022 - 22,091 steps&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;2022 TELL Step Up Challenge: October 10, 2022 - 22,091 steps&#34; src=&#34;../../../../assets/assets/images/2022-10-10-tell-step-up-challenge-%2810-10%29.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next year, I want to have some other activities lined up besides walking, like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Writing blog posts that total X number of words,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reading for X seconds of yoga within the event period, and/or&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creating a playlist that includes X seconds of easy-listening music to relax to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;wrap-up&#34;&gt;Wrap-up&lt;a class=&#34;headerlink&#34; href=&#34;#wrap-up&#34; title=&#34;Permanent link&#34;&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Asahi Beer Hall and Tokyo SkyTree&#34; src=&#34;../../../../assets/assets/images/2022-10-10-asahi-beer-hall-tokyo-skytree.jpg&#34; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A view of the Asahi Beer Hall and Tokyo SkyTree from my walk on October 10, 2022&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll definitely participate in this event in the future and continue to promote TELL&#39;s support services to English speakers. Now that I know a bit more about how the event works, I&#39;ll also consider participating with a small group next time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For English speakers living in Japan who are struggling and need someone to talk to, I recommend contacting TELL through their &lt;a href=&#34;https://telljp.com/lifeline/&#34;&gt;Lifeline service&lt;/a&gt;. The organization&#39;s website also regularly posts on their blog and offers a plethora of resources if you prefer to get help at your own pace our outside of their support hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of us struggle at some point, so I highly recommend keeping TELL top of mind if you find yourself going through a difficult time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Most of the following definitions are courtesy of Wikipedia, unless otherwise noted. --&gt;&lt;!-- *[Bitcoin]: An innovative proof-of-work blockchain payment network and a new kind of money --&gt;&lt;!-- Definition based on Bitcoin.org --&gt;</description><link>https://www.080f53.com/blog/2022/10/recap-of-my-participation-in-the-2022-tell-21007-step-up-challenge/?utm_source=documentation&amp;utm_medium=RSS&amp;utm_campaign=feed-syndication</link> <pubDate>Tue, 11 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0900</pubDate><source url="https://www.080f53.com/feed_rss_created.xml">josh-wong | blog and projects</source><comments>https://www.080f53.com/blog/2022/10/recap-of-my-participation-in-the-2022-tell-21007-step-up-challenge/#__comments</comments><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.080f53.com/blog/2022/10/recap-of-my-participation-in-the-2022-tell-21007-step-up-challenge/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Hello World!🌏</title> <author>josh-wong</author> <category>General</category> <category>general</category> <category>hello world</category> <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;hello-world&#34;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&#34;A phrase used to illustrate a language&#39;s basic syntax when programming&#34;&gt;Hello World&lt;/abbr&gt;!🌏&lt;a class=&#34;headerlink&#34; href=&#34;#hello-world&#34; title=&#34;Permanent link&#34;&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is my first blog post!✍🏻&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Most of the following definitions are courtesy of Wikipedia, unless otherwise noted. --&gt;&lt;!-- *[Bitcoin]: An innovative proof-of-work blockchain payment network and a new kind of money --&gt;&lt;!-- Definition based on Bitcoin.org --&gt;</description><link>https://www.080f53.com/blog/2022/10/hello-world/?utm_source=documentation&amp;utm_medium=RSS&amp;utm_campaign=feed-syndication</link> <pubDate>Tue, 04 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0900</pubDate><source url="https://www.080f53.com/feed_rss_created.xml">josh-wong | blog and projects</source><comments>https://www.080f53.com/blog/2022/10/hello-world/#__comments</comments><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.080f53.com/blog/2022/10/hello-world/</guid> </item> </channel></rss>
