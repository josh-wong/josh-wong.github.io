Without DDNS, you'd need to manually update the IP address in your domain name service provider account, which would require constant oversight.</p> <p>Most domain name service providers offer a DDNS service, which periodically checks for changes to an IP address and then automatically updates the DDNS database when a new IP address is discovered. For details on how to enable DDNS for your domain name, please check your domain name service provider's documentation.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>After enabling DDNS in your domain name service account, you should receive a password.
