The purpose of this event is to raise mental-health awareness and funds for TELL to continue providing lifesaving services to the English-speaking community in Japan. Although you can participate in the event solo or as a group, I decided to join as an individual.</p>  <p>By registering for the event, you may be eligible to receive event goodies (while supplies last!). This year's goodie bag included a nice tote bag, which was perfect for holding my water bottle, phone, wallet, keys, and any groceries I bought during my walks.</p>  <p> </p> 2022 TELL Step Up Challenge swag: tote bag and sticker  <p>For details about the Step Up Challenge and other events, see TELL Japan events.</p>","location":"blog/2022/10/recap-of-the-2022-tell-21007-step-up-challenge/"},{"title":"Why I'm taking part in the 2022 Step Up Challenge","text":"<p>I heard about TELL on Twitter a few years ago, but I didn't know about this event until I read about it on the \"TELL 21,081 Steps\" blog post on nanikore.net.</p> <p>Living in Japan can get rough for nonnative residents. I had heard about how many foreigners struggle with how to proceed after around five years because of being homesick, wanting a better job, or other factors. I experienced a similar situation around my five-year anniversary mark. If I knew about TELL at that time, I believe I would have gotten the support that I needed and potentially saved quite a lot of yen on questionably helpful self-help books.</p> <p>Simply put: I believe in TELL's service and want to support their mission.</p>","location":"blog/2022/10/recap-of-the-2022-tell-21007-step-up-challenge/#why-im-taking-part-in-the-2022-step-up-challenge"},{"title":"How I participated in the 2022 Step Up Challenge","text":"<p>To honor the 21,007 people who lost their lives to suicide in 2021, I walked 21,007+ steps around Tokyo on the following dates.</p>  September 10, 2022 - 21,034 steps <p></p>   September 17, 2022 - 22,197 steps <p></p>   October 10, 2022 - 22,091 steps <p></p>  <p>Next year, I want to have some other activities lined up besides walking, like:</p> <ul> <li>Writing blog posts that total X number of words,</li> <li>Reading for X seconds of yoga within the event period, and/or</li> <li>Creating a playlist that includes X seconds of easy-listening music to relax to.</li> </ul>","location":"blog/2022/10/recap-of-the-2022-tell-21007-step-up-challenge/#how-i-participated-in-the-2022-step-up-challenge"},{"title":"Wrap-up","text":"<p> </p> A view of the Asahi Beer Hall and Tokyo SkyTree from my walk on October 10, 2022  <p>I'll definitely participate in this event in the future and continue to promote TELL's support services to English speakers. Now that I know a bit more about how the event works, I'll also consider participating with a small group next time.</p> <p>For English speakers living in Japan who are struggling and need someone to talk to, I recommend contacting TELL through their Lifeline service. The organization's website also regularly posts on their blog and offers a plethora of resources if you prefer to get help at your own pace our outside of their support hours.</p> <p>Many of us struggle at some point, so I highly recommend keeping TELL top of mind if you find yourself going through a difficult time.</p>","location":"blog/2022/10/recap-of-the-2022-tell-21007-step-up-challenge/#wrap-up"},{"title":"Scripts","text":"<ul> <li> <p> app-open-close script</p>  <p>Script for automating the process of opening a specific app, allowing data to sync, and then close the app.</p> </li> <li> <p> commit-submit-merge script</p>  <p>Script for automating the commit, submit, and merge process for pull requests in GitHub.</p> </li> <li> <p> remove-folder and copy-folder scripts</p>  <p>Script for automating the process of copying files from one folder into another folder on Windows.</p> </li> </ul>","location":"projects/scripts/"},{"title":"Software","text":"<ul> <li> <p> passGen</p>  <p>Lightweight Windows app for creating randomly generated, 10-character passwords</p> </li> </ul>","location":"projects/software/"},{"title":"Tutorials &amp; notes","text":"<ul> <li> <p> Bitcoin Cash Node on a Raspberry Pi</p>  <p>Tutorials for how to install, set up, and upgrade Bitcoin Cash Node on a Raspberry Pi 4 running Ubuntu Desktop (64-bit)</p> </li> <li> <p> Microsoft Zune &amp; software setup</p>  <p>Tutorial for how to connect a Microsoft Zune device to the Zune software on Windows</p> </li> <li> <p> My Kindle highlights &amp; notes</p>  <p>Highlights and notes from books I have read or am currently reading on Kindle</p> </li> <li> <p> TP-Link router hard reset</p>  <p>Tutorial for how to perform a hard reset on a TP-Link Wi-Fi router</p> </li> </ul>","location":"projects/tutorials_notes/"}]}
